The Android touchscreen synthesizer.

Lowering the sample rate may help in reducing playback problems.

**5 waveforms (sine, triangle, square, sawtooth, reverse sawtooth)**

**attack, release and volume for each keyboard**

**selectable octave range for each keyboard**

Network access is used for google analitycs.
